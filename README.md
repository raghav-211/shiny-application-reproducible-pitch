# shiny-application-reproducible-pitch

Created this for a Coursera Project, Data Science Specialization, JHU. It takes the statistics from http://www.sberbank.com/ru/opendata. Based on selected parameters like the variable(statistic) to be shown and the time range, it plots the graph with 3 choices of visualizations.
